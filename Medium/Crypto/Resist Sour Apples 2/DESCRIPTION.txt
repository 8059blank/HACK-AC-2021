Now that we have established your skills, this
time round, we would like to see if you can find
any vulnerability with our new encryption method.

One of our members have come up with a new method
of encrypting data using our signature RSA
encryption scheme and the "Binomial Theorem", as
detailed in the "encryptor.py" script attached.

It randomly generates 3 small integers, a, b, and
c, and uses them to generate n. That way, our
members can easily derive the public key used in 
our secret communications by just remembering 3
small integers.

We believe that the encryption method is
fool-proof, but just in case, we would like you to
take a look.

We have encrypted a flag, and provided the various
parameters in the "enc" file attached. If you are
able to crack our encryption method, please send 
us the flag as proof that our encryption method is
insecure. Good Luck!
