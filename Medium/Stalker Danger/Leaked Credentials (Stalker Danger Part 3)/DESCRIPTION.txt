The secret files were great, but they were incomplete. I managed to find his amazon data, but the last two characters of the Access Key are missing..

```
Region: us-east-1
Access Key ID: AKIARKFM6I6QZIHAO5
Secret Key: 6i1Q+GXXh7bYq51HNw6ICvSoFrLCKCs3Wve+Oq0O
```

Note: The flag is the correct valid AWS Key ID. For example, if the AWS Key ID is: ABCDEFG, the flag is ACSI{ABCDEFG}
