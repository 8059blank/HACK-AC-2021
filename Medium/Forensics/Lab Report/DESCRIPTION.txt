So... John (aka horlicks truck) downloaded 16GB of ram from the internet....
Evidently, that went wrong. Very wrong. Now we need your help to answer the following questions.

1) What is his PC password
2) What is his default browser
3) What is the name of the deleted Executable (exe) file
4) What is the name of the virus on his laptop

**Flag format: ACSI{password_default-browser_name-of-file_virus-name}**

**Note that the answers to question 1-4 should be in lowercase.**


For example, if his password is abc123, his default browser is Chrome, the name of the file is xyz.exe, and the virus is CryptoLocker, the flag will be:
ACSI{abc123_chrome_xyz.exe_cryptolocker}


**WARNING: There are real samples of malware inside this challenge, please do not run any of the executables on your laptop.**
