We are a coalition of individuals who resist sour
apples, as they are gross.

As part of your Cryptography training, you have
been provided a flag encrypted in our signature
RSA encryption scheme.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is
to find the vulnerability, decipher the
ciphertext, and send us the flag as proof that you
have completed the challenge.
