Ahh, I see you got stuck in my CTF, Marcus the duck.

Just in time to witness by latest invention - the XORinator!

It can encode any message and with a secret key...

Mwahahaha! Nobody can read my secret messages now...

In fact, I'm so sure that it's secure, that I'll even give you a hint.

The secret key is 8 bytes long... haha!

Let's see if you can decode my message to get the flag!
