Elliot joined the London School of Beconomics. There, he learnt the art of beconomics.
Recently, Elliot went to Itacho Sushi and was impressed by their Mini rice bowl. 
Not only was it extermeley expensive, the cost price was so low that even he was amazed by their beconomics. 

Elliot: Why is this so horrendously costly.
Manager: Don't forget you paid for a flag all the way from the London School of Beconomics
Elliot: Huh? What is this flag even??

Find the flag and hopefully make Elliot feel that his $4.50 for a Salmon Mini Rice Bowl was worth it.
